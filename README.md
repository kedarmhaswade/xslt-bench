# xslt-bench
Just contains a script to try out certain XSL transformations using saxon.

## Setup
Somehow download the [saxon parser](http://www.saxonica.com/html/documentation/using-xsl/commandline.html) and place it somewhere convenient. The script is set up to leverage Maven and cygwin. Modify the classpath as you see fit after downloading the parser.
